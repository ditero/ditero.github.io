    <div class="container">   <p>Home to the biggest mall in the world (the imaginatively titled Dubai Mall) and with high-end retail locations seemingly on every corner, itâ€™s no surprise that visitors come to Dubai from far and wide for a bit of retail therapy.
         While many countries have January Sales after Christmas, Dubai has a month-long shopping festival with concerts and giveaways where shoppers can win cars and gold.</p>

           <p>I would like to learn Somali language due to the fact that Somalians have dominated the Spaza
             shops business in Township. I meet a Somalian almost every day and they are learning
             Xhosa language as we communicate with them as Consumers</p>

            <p id="dimg">Clock Tower</p><p>The V&A Waterfront Clock Tower is situated in Table Bay Harbour, close to the site of the original Bertie's Landing restaurant. Much of the Waterfront's charm lies in the fact that this busy commercial harbour is set in
              the midst of a huge entertainment venue with restaurants, specialty shops, craft markets, theatres and movies.</p>

           <p id="dimg">Time Ball Tower</p><p>Heading west, on the other side of Dock Road above the car park, is the 1894
             Time Ball Tower; its purpose was to act as an accurate reference for ships' navigators who set their clocks as the ball on the roof fell.
             Correct time was vital for navigators to be able to determine precise longitude. Beside the tower is a 110-year-old dragon tree,
             Dracaeno draco, from the Canary Islands, and next to the tree is the original harbour master's residence (1860).</p>

            <p id="dimg">Swing Bridge</p><p>The bridge swings over the link between the Alfred Basin and the Victoria Basin in the
              Victoria & Alfred Waterfront. It was designed and constructed in 1997.</p>
