           <p>I would like to learn Somali language due to the fact that Somalians have dominated the Spaza
             shops business in Township. I meet a Somalian almost every day and they are learning
             Xhosa language as we communicate with them as Consumers</p>

           <h3 >Historic places in the V&A Waterfront</h3>

            <div class="product-places">
            <p id="dimg">Clock Tower</p><p>The V&A Waterfront Clock Tower is situated in Table Bay Harbour, close to the site of the
               original Bertie's Landing restaurant. Much of the Waterfront's charm lies in the fact that this busy commercial harbour is set in
              the midst of a huge entertainment venue with restaurants, specialty shops, craft markets, theatres and movies.</p>
              <ul>
                <li> This was the original Port Captain's Office completed in 1882.</li>
                <li>On the second floor is a decorative mirror room, which enabled the Port Captain to have a view of all activities in the harbour.</li>
                <li>On the bottom floor is a tide-gauge mechanism used to check the level of the tide. Restoration of the Clock Tower was completed towards the end of 1997.</li>
              </ul>

        <div class="product-places">
           <p id="dimg">Time Ball Tower</p><p>Heading west, on the other side of Dock Road above the car park, is the 1894
             Time Ball Tower; its purpose was to act as an accurate reference for ships'
             navigators who set their clocks as the ball on the roof fell. Correct time was vital for navigators
             to be able to determine precise longitude.</p>
             <ul>
               <li>The Time Ball (invented by Captain Robert Wauchope) is a signaling device in which a ball is dropped at a given time in order for
                 ships' masters to determine the error and rate of their chronometers whilst in harbour</li>
               <li>The Time Ball Tower in the Waterfront was built in 1894 and is situated next the
                 Harbour Engineer's former residence (Dock House).</li>
                 <li>It remained in use for 40 years after which new technology led to it lying idle for 63 years before being
                   restored and officially recommissioned in November 1997.</li>
             </ul>
